# AnimeFilms

Welcome to your new gem! In this directory, you'll find the files you need to be able to package up your Ruby library into a gem. Put your Ruby code in the file `lib/anime_films`. To experiment with that code, run `bin/console` for an interactive prompt.

## Installation

Add this line to your application's Gemfile:

```ruby
gem 'anime_films'
```

And then execute:

    $ bundle install

Or install it yourself as:

    $ gem install anime_films

## Usage

To run application type bin/console and follow 
instruction on the screen. 

## Development

After checking out the repo, run `bin/setup` to install dependencies. You can also run `ruby lib/anime_films/anime_info.rb` for an interactive prompt that will allow you to experiment.

To install this gem onto your local machine, run `bundle exec rake install`. To release a new version, update the version number in `version.rb`, and then run `bundle exec rake release`, which will create a git tag for the version, push git commits and tags, and push the `.gem` file to [rubygems.org](https://rubygems.org).
